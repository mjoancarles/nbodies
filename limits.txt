We got the following results executing our program:

"Number of bodies" -> "Execution Time"
With 100 bodies -> 0-1 milliseconds
With 1.000 bodies -> 40 milliseconds
With 5.000 bodies -> 1 second
With 10.000 bodies -> 4,5 seconds

So we can assert that the relation between the time and the number of bodies is not linear, it seems to be a quadratic
or a similar one because as long as we increase the number of bodies, the executing time increases much faster.

As the program stands, to get a good performance, we would have to use a number of bodies less or equal than 1000.
